# admm
This is the final project of EE227BT (Convex optimization) Fall 2017 at UC Berkeley.
This project is largely based on the excellent paper of Boyd on ADMM:
http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/admm_distr_stats.html.

The Python code I used is adapted from the original MATLAB code and C code, which can be found in their website:
